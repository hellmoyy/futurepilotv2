### 1. **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**
```typescript
// /src/app/api/news/route.ts

const majorBearishEvents = [
  'fed raises rates', 'market crash', 'exchange hack', 'sec charges',
  'bankruptcy', 'banned', 'collapse', 'recession'
];

const majorBullishEvents = [
  'etf approved', 'interest cut', 'institutional buying', 'halving',
  'all-time high', 'bullrun'
];

// Major events get 2x sentiment weight
bearishKeywords.forEach(keyword => {
  if (text.includes(keyword)) {
    const isMajor = majorBearishEvents.some(event => text.includes(event));
    bearishScore += isMajor ? 2 : 1;
  }
});
```

### 2. **Event Detection in News Formatting**
```typescript
// /src/lib/crypto-news.ts

function detectMajorEvent(title: string): string | null {
  const majorEvents = [
    { keywords: ['fed', 'federal reserve'], icon: '🏦', label: 'FED NEWS' },
    { keywords: ['crash', 'market crash'], icon: '📉', label: 'MARKET CRASH' },
    { keywords: ['sec charges'], icon: '⚖️', label: 'SEC ACTION' },
    // ... more events
  ];
  
  for (const event of majorEvents) {
    if (event.keywords.some(keyword => lowerTitle.includes(keyword))) {
      return `${event.icon} ${event.label}`;
    }
  }
