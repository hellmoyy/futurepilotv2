## 🚨 Important Notes

### Limitations:

1. **Screenshot Timing**
   - Analysis based on image moment
   - Market may have moved since
   - Always verify current price

2. **Indicator Accuracy**
   - AI reads visible indicators
   - Some indicators may be unclear
   - Verify indicator values

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - AI detects common patterns
   - Subjective patterns may vary
   - Use as guidance, not absolute

### Disclaimers:

⚠️ **Trading Risk**
- All trading involves risk
- Past patterns don't guarantee future results
- Use proper risk management
- Never trade with money you can't afford to lose

⚠️ **Not Financial Advice**
- AI analysis is educational
- Do your own research (DYOR)
- Consult financial advisor
- You are responsible for your trades

## 💰 Token Usage

**Image Analysis Costs More:**
- Text-only message: ~2,500 tokens (~$0.01)
- With image (high detail): ~5,000-8,000 tokens (~$0.02-$0.04)

**Optimization Tips:**
1. Don't send unnecessarily large images
2. Crop to show only relevant chart area
3. Use "low" detail for simple questions
4. Limit image messages in conversation
